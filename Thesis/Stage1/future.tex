\chapter{Future work}


\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Parallelization} - Achieve parallelization first on ~4 cores using OpenMP and then on a large scale using MPI. Strive for scalability of the algorithm over multiple cores. Answer the question- Do the communication overheads dominate over the speedup obtained by parallelism? When does this domination start to show?

\item \textit{Deciding Orthonormal functions} - Currently, random orthonormal functions are chosen to decompose the problem. Can an ON function-choosing heuristic help speedup the algorithm?

\item \textit{Library of decomposition techniques} - Use a variety of decomposition techniques in the algorithm developed.
