% Abstract text - Type abstract here
\noindent SAT solvers are used in various domains like artificial intelligence, circuit design, automatic theorem proving, etc. With increasingly large search spaces, greater speed in solving is required. Modern SAT solvers are using available multi-core systems to achieve speedup in SAT solving. In this work we present a parallel SAT solver based on Orthonormal function decomposition \cite{sule14}. The solver will be implemented on clusters of computers, using OpenMP and MPI (Message Passing Interface). The main features of the program are described. The solver could also be used to solve other NP-hard problems like Travelling Salesman problem, Discrete Logarithm problem and more.
