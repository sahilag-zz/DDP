Parallel implementation of ONexpansion

Part1: decomposing given cnf into subproblems

Part2: solving subproblems in parallel

-- CONTENTS --

CNFs being used:

12pipe_bug1_q0.cnf : SAT 
engine_4.cnf : UNSAT
engine_6_nd_case1.cnf : UNSAT

My code:

Part1:
	main.cpp

	mySolver_freq.cpp: 

		-- splits the cnf using a variable at each stage
		-- splitting variable decided by most frequent in current simplified cnf
		-- prints out all generated cnfs
	
	mySolver_freq1.cpp:
	
		-- same as above except prints out all assumptions instead of cnfs
		
	mySolver_fixed.cpp:
		
		-- same as mySolver_freq.cpp except variable splitting order fixed

Part2:
	
	part2.cpp:
	
		-- for mySolver_fixed1.cpp
		-- takes original cnf and adds assumptions to it. solve using minisat
		-- prints SAT/UNSAT to .sol file


Exexution:

	script: executes part1 --> splits cnf into subproblems, will either print 
			cnfs or assumptions
			
	solve:
